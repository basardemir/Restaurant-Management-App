Parts Implemented by Mehmet Can GÃ¼n
************************************

CODE STRUCTURE
---------------

We basically implement the MVC pattern, which is Modal, View, Controller approach. This method provides us to use our methods by calling in a structure.

Models Folder
===============

Containing database connection codes for forms.

* company.py
* card.py
* order.py

Pages Folder
===============

Containing pages to be connected with views page.

* company.py
* card.py
* order.py

Forms Folder in Pages Folder
==============================

Containing wtfforms forms to be called in pages and used in views.

Also, forms contains validations.

* company_form.py
* card_form.py
* order_form.py
* comment_form.py


views.py
===============

Containing the pages for import to use in urls.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../views.py
  :lines: 4,8,13
  :linenos:
  :language: python
  :caption: views.py


util.py
===============

| This file is used only for adding 'list' into Flask urls in order to convert urls in spite of html markup.
| Basically, if you send list with link, then the url shows data seperated by comma.
| [util.py]_ ListConventer is implemented with BaseConverter 
| In the 4-5 lines of **server.py**, adding the list to flask map structure
